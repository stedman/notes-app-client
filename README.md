This app was created whilst following step 2 of the "Let’s Build a MongoDB + Express + React + GraphQL + Relay Modern Full Stack Web App (From Scratch!)" tutorial series:
1. [Back End Part](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/lets-build-a-mongodb-express-react-graphql-relay-modern-full-stack-web-app-from-scratch-a4ae3aaf212)
2. [Front End Part](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/lets-build-a-mongodb-express-react-graphql-relay-modern-full-stack-web-app-from-scratch-d41b5091d41d)

I managed to slog through the tutorial even though some of the directory structure was unclear and some of the dependencies weren't noted in the instructions (e.g., `react-relay`, `relay-runtime`). I also question the inclusion of [Relay](https://relay.dev/en/) — it certainly looks useful but there is no explanation in the text for how all the parts work together. The tutorial seemed rather rushed into rote cutting-and-pasting semi-functional code at the end. I wonder if it was trying to accomplish too many things in one sitting.

I look forward to digging into React and Relay a bit more. So on that point, the tutorial was a success. Interest has been piqued.
